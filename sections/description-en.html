<h2 id="desc" class="list">Mapping Quality Vocabulary (MQV) Metrics: Description <span class="backlink"> back to <a href="#toc">ToC</a></span></h2>
<span class="markdown">
The metrics within this ontology are designed to assess the quality of mappings using three different aspects of R2RML mapping quality, which are mapping quality, data quality and vocabulary quality. 
</br>
• <b> Mapping Quality Aspect (MP) - </b> Firstly, we consider the quality of the mapping itself, by assessing, for instance, the extent to which the mapping correctly conforms to the specification of the R2RML mapping language used and also, whether there are any redundant definitions within the mapping (which would affect the performance of R2RML mapping engines). 
</br>
<b> • Data Quality Aspect (D) - </b> The second aspect relates to the quality of the output generated by an engine processing the input data and the R2RML mapping. Poor design decisions made at the stage of defining a R2RML mapping, such as using non-dereferenceable  classes and properties, or deprecated ones, will decrease the quality of the dataset. This aspect focuses on the quality of the output data which can be identified and fixed during mapping design-time. 
</br>
<b> • Vocabulary Quality Aspect (VOC). </b> Finally, the third aspect we consider relates to the quality of the vocabularies used within the R2RML mapping, by assessing for instance, that these classes and properties contain human readable labels or comments in the vocabulary. The rationale for including this aspect is to ensure the quality of the resulting datasets by making quality information related to the vocabularies being used in the mapping transparent to mapping engineers.
